This was my 3rd year CS project 2 in 2022. I achieved 93% for the project.

# Web-development project spec:
You are required to create a web-based social network that is focused on users interacting with
one another on geo-tagged posts and/or messages. Users must be able to interact with one
another by creating and joining groups on which they make posts, and comment on these posts.
Text and video posts must be able to be made by the user. At least one of the aforementioned
interactions must be geo-tagged but all must have timestamps. These groups are fully sovereign
i.e. groups run themselves.


## Things to note:
- This was a group project of 6 developers
- I was responsible for most of the front-end development

## Stack:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Flask
- Database: MySQL
